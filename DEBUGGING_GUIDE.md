# Debugging Guide for Payment Error

## Current Issue

The user is still experiencing the contract error `AAAAAAAAAAD////wAAAAAA==` (AlreadyPaid = 5) even after the frontend fix. This suggests that the frontend is still trying to pay for a round that has already been paid.

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
The user should:
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Right-click on the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. Or use Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh

### 2. Check Console Logs
After refreshing, the user should check the browser console for these debug messages:

```
Round 1 payment status: true
Round 2 payment status: false
Next unpaid round: 2
Has paid for any round: true
Setting current round to: 2
```

### 3. Verify UI Display
The UI should show:
- **Title**: "Putaran 2" (not "Putaran 1")
- **Payment Button**: "Bayar Iuran Putaran 2" (not "Bayar Iuran Putaran 1")

### 4. Check Payment Attempt
When clicking the payment button, the console should show:
```
About to check payment status for round: 2
Payment status for round 2: false
CRITICAL: About to pay for round: 2
CRITICAL: User should NOT pay for round 1 if they already paid for it
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **Frontend loads**: Should detect round 1 is paid, round 2 is unpaid
2. **UI shows**: "Putaran 2" and "Bayar Iuran Putaran 2"
3. **Payment attempt**: Should pay for round 2, not round 1
4. **Success**: Payment should complete without errors

## If Issue Persists

If the user is still trying to pay for round 1, it means:

1. **Browser cache issue**: Need to clear cache completely
2. **Frontend not updated**: Need to restart the development server
3. **Code not applied**: Need to verify the changes are saved

## Manual Verification

The user can verify the payment status manually by checking the browser console for:
- Round 1 status should be `true` (already paid)
- Round 2 status should be `false` (not paid yet)
- Current round should be set to `2`

## Files Modified

- `arisan-oc-frontend/app/routes/arisan.$id.tsx`: Added extensive debugging logs

## Next Steps

1. User should refresh the browser with cache cleared
2. Check console logs to verify round detection
3. Verify UI shows correct round number
4. Attempt payment and check console logs
5. Report back with console output if issue persists
